# GraphQL Server 

This is an exmaple code for how to write a basic GraphQL server. GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it efficient and flexible.


## Problems GraphQL solves 
GraphQL solves major problems associated with traditional REST APIs, including over-fetching and under-fetching of data, the need for multiple round trips to the server, versioning issues, complex data fetching, the lack of a strongly typed schema, and limited support for real-time updates


## Setup 

1. git clone https://github.com/Aloksh42/graphql-server.git
2. Run npm install to install all the dependencies
3. Run npm start to start the project on localhost:4000
4. Now make different Queries & Mutations
